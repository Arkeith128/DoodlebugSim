Main Driver: Simulation.java

Run Simulation.java to display the world. X represents a Doodlebug and o represents an Ant. 
Each round the organism will move to one unoccupied spot in the world. 
The ant's job is to survive while the doodlebug's job is to eat the ant. 
The organisms will breed after a set amount of moves and will starve if they go without eating for a set amount of moves

This Project uses inheritance and abstraction.
